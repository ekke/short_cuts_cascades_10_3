HowTo use Shortcuts from 10.2 to 10.3.0 / 10.3.1 Classic

sometimes there are slight differences how Cascades is dealing with shortcuts on Classic - in one of my apps I had to move shortcuts from Page to LisView to make them run on Classic, where Passport only recognizes the shortcuts at Page level.

there's a 10.2 branch if you want to make it run on 10.2 devices
Master is 10.3.0 branch running on Passport or Classic
